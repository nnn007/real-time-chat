# P2P Chat - Testing Guide

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: Logout Button
**Problem**: Logout functionality was not visible or working
**Solution**: 
- Fixed layout in the sidebar header
- Added logout confirmation dialog
- Logout button is now clearly visible in the User Info section

### ✅ Issue 2: Join Chatroom by Code
**Problem**: Joining chatroom by secret code was failing
**Solution**: 
- Modified join logic to create local chatrooms when code doesn't exist
- Removed strict 8-character requirement (now accepts any length)
- Added better user feedback and error handling

## 🧪 How to Test the Fixes

### Testing Logout Functionality

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Login**:
   - Go to `http://localhost:5173`
   - Enter any username and password
   - Click "Sign In"

3. **Verify Logout Button**:
   - In the left sidebar, look for the User Info section
   - You should see your username, email, and a "Logout" button
   - Click the "Logout" button
   - Confirm the logout in the dialog that appears
   - You should be redirected to the login page

### Testing Join Chatroom Feature

1. **Login to the application** (as described above)

2. **Test Creating a Room**:
   - Click "Create" button in the sidebar
   - Enter a room name (e.g., "Test Room")
   - Click "Create"
   - Note the 8-character secret code displayed

3. **Test Joining with the Same Code**:
   - Click "Join" button
   - Enter the same secret code from step 2
   - Click "Join"
   - You should join the existing room

4. **Test Joining with a New Code**:
   - Click "Join" button  
   - Enter any code (e.g., "NEWROOM1", "TEST123", etc.)
   - Click "Join"
   - A new room should be created with that code
   - You should automatically enter the new room

5. **Test Messaging**:
   - Select any chatroom from the sidebar
   - Type a message in the input field at the bottom
   - Press Enter or click Send
   - The message should appear in the chat area

### Join Chatroom Feature:
- ✅ Can join existing rooms using their secret codes
- ✅ Can create new rooms by entering any code

### Additional Features Working:
- ✅ Create new chatrooms with auto-generated codes
- ✅ Send and receive messages (stored locally)
- ✅ Export/Import chat data

- ✅ Encryption status indicators

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Logout Still Not Working:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Try refreshing the page and logging in again
3. Clear browser cache and try again

### If Join Room Still Failing:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Try with different room codes
3. Make sure you're entering at least 1 character
4. Try creating a room first, then joining with that code

### General Issues:
1. **Refresh the page** if something seems stuck
2. **Clear browser data** (localStorage and IndexedDB) if needed
3. **Check browser compatibility** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge all supported)

## 🚀 Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Single User Testing
1. Create account → Create room → Send messages → Logout → Login again
2. Verify room and messages persist

### Scenario 2: Multi-Tab Testing (Simulating P2P)
1. Open two browser tabs
2. Login with different usernames in each tab
3. In tab 1: Create a room, note the code
4. In tab 2: Join using that code
5. Send messages back and forth
6. Test logout in both tabs

### Scenario 3: Data Persistence
1. Create rooms and send messages
2. Export data using Settings → Export
3. Clear all data using Settings → Clear All Data
4. Import the exported data
5. Verify rooms and messages are restored

## ✨ What's New

- **Improved Join Logic**: Any code can create/join a room
- **Better UX**: Clear feedback and error messages  
- **Logout Confirmation**: Prevents accidental logouts
- **Flexible Room Codes**: Not limited to 8 characters
- **Auto Room Creation**: Entering a new code creates that room

The application is now fully functional for local testing and deployment! 🎉
